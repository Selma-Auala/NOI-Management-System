# NOI Management System

## Business Vision

NOI Coding Kids is a dynamic after school kids coding academy aimed at educating children from the ages of 5-17 on basic computer programming and basic computer skills. NOI Coding Kid’s curriculum covers topics from web development, game development and robotics. The main aim for NOI Coding kids is to provide quality education on Technology and to develop the next generation of advanced computer literate children and young software developers. The NOI School Management System project tracks, monitors and manages the daily activities of the coding academy such as the monitoring student and tutors attendance, managing student and tutors profiles etc.

In comparison to the current reality, the current reality is that NOI Coding Kids has no management system instead it uses software such as excel and google forms to monitor and manage its daily tasks. The project will change the current reality by having a centralized system do all these task simultaneously.

This project will allow the academy to be able to digitalize majority of it processes and to have one centralized system that will handle all the appropriate tasks. Other planned projects include an E-learning system where learners can access material provided by the tutors as well as be able to do assessments on that platform.

## The Proposed Solution
### Solution Overview
The NOI School Management System is a 3-tier web application that will monitor, track and manage the daily activities of the NOI Coding Kids Academy. The System will consist of multiple dashboards namely Admin, Tutor and Student dashboard and will have to be optimized for both mobile view, desktop view and tablet view.
#### Admin Dashboard
The admin Dashboard will display create, edit, delete and display student records, create, edit, delete and display tutors records and as well as create, edit, delete and display attendance records.

#### Tutors Dashboard
The tutor’s dashboard will display student records which is inclusive of their performance records and attendance records. The tutor will be able to log in attendance as well as record grades and complaints.

#### Student Dashboard
Student dashboard will display their overall performance records, assigned/assessed/overdue homework/assignment/assessments and as well as their grades.

## Strategic Alignment
The solutions outlines supports and complies with the corporate strategy of ensuring quality education in Tech and developing advanced computer literate children and young software developers by enabling the academy to assess the quality of education through the grades of the students and their progress.
